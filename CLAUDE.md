## Branch naming strategy

Since many people will be contributing to this repository, we use a branching strategy that allows for parallel development while keeping the main branch stable.

Use the following branching strategy:

`<human first name>/<work type>/<work name>`

For example:

- `john/feat/add-packages`
- `jane/fix/ui-bugs`
- `joy/refactor/payment`

`<human first name>` - will be derived from `git config user.name` or the author's first name. Ask the author for their first name if it's not available.
`<work type>` - the type of work being done (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`). Should match commit types from conventional commits.
`<work name>` - the name of the work being done (e.g., `add-packages`, `ui-bugs`, `payment`)
